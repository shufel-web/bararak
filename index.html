    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the base:</strong> Add about 4 litres of water to a large pan. Roughly chop the bananas (including skins) and add them to the pan with the sultanas.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Simmer:</strong> Bring to the boil, then reduce heat and let it simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare tea & lemon:</strong> Brew the teabag in a mug of boiling water. Juice the lemon and add the juice to the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mash:</strong> After about 5 minutes of simmering, mash the fruit in the pan. Continue until there are no large chunks. Be careful of hot splashes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add tea:</strong> Remove the teabag from the mug and add the brewed tea to the pan. Stir well.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cool slightly:</strong> Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow the mixture to cool. Leaving it overnight will develop more flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Strain:</strong> Strain the liquid into a clean pan using a sieve and muslin cloth. Do not squeeze the pulp through the cloth.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add sugar & sterilize:</strong> Return the strained liquid to heat, bring to a quick boil, then stir in the sugar until dissolved. Turn off the heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cool again:</strong> Allow the liquid to cool for about an hour or place the pan in a sink of cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Transfer to fermenter:</strong> Pour the cooled liquid into a sterilised demijohn using a funnel. Fit the airlock immediately. Never pour boiling liquid into glass.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Optional – Add pectolase:</strong> Add now if using, to help clearing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add yeast:</strong> Add wine yeast according to package instructions. Leave to ferment in a warm, dark place.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Racking Schedule</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First rack: After 1 week</li>
        <li>Second rack: At 3 weeks</li>
        <li>Third rack: At 6 weeks</li>
        <li>Final rack: Once fermentation stops</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bottling</h2>
    <p>
        Bottle once the wine has cleared and fermentation is fully finished — usually after at least 3 months (6–12 months is better).
    </p>

    <h3>Important Warnings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bottling too early can cause bottles to explode.</li>
        <li>Beginners should use a stabiliser to stop active yeast.</li>
        <li>Too much sediment at bottling can cause off-flavors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Aging</h3>
    <p>
        For best results, age the bottled wine for at least <strong>1 year</strong> before drinking.
